## macOS Installation Note

As this application is not signed with an Apple Developer Certificate, macOS users may encounter the following error when opening the app:

```
"GH Analyzer.app" is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin.
```

To resolve this issue, open Terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/path/to/GH Analyzer.app"
```

Replace `/path/to/GH Analyzer.app` with the actual path to the application. This command removes the macOS quarantine attribute that's blocking the app from running.
